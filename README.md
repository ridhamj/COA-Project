# COA-Project

We have built a web-based platform to connect users directly with nearby hospitals and facilitate the process of scheduling an appointment with the hospital to get vaccinated.

*Why our Platform?*

1. Proper Management of Vaccine Distribution. 
2. Database of all vaccinated people. 
3. Reducing possible crowding at clinics/ hospitals when the vaccine becomes public.
